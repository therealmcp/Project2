# Let's Play

![gripapp image](public/images/landing.png) 
# Overview
This full stack application allows gamers to find other people to game with based on social preferences, skill level, objectives, specific games, etc. Are you a competitive gamer looking to hone your skills or someone looking to casually learn a new game with chill people? Let's Play has you covered! 

It includes data persistence using MySQL, data retrieval via JawsDB, Front-end UI/UX using HTML/CSS and Handlebars, and finally utilizes an Express server built with Node.js.  

## Walkthrough
Our app starts with login page so each user can access their own friends, feed, etc.

Feel free to create a user account by clicking "Sign Up". We recommend using dummy information as we have yet to implement data encryption.

Once you have created an account take the gaming test to see what kind of gamer you are and be assigned a badge. You badge will tell other people what you prioritize while gaming.
